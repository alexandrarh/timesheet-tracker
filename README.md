# TimeSolv Timesheet Tracker
Built with Python and GitHub Actions, this aims to validate TimeSolv firm employees' timesheets, and pick up on any users that don't submit timesheets for certain dates during the work week. This bot runs weekly to ensure everyone is evaluated accordingly.

## How it works
The checker runs automatically on a schedule and validates timesheet completeness:

The workflow fetches user information and timesheet data from TimeSolv and user information, identifies missing entries, notifies affected users via email with calls to Microsoft Graph API, and sends a summary report to administrators.
